# Arcade Console
<i>High hair, Trans-Am's, Skating Rinks, Parachute Pants and Video Arcades.  Time to go back to the future with an old-school console that plays all the golden-oldies</i>

This one will darn near be a direct rip-off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLice_sU_6Rfhw7LK-tl8A8u1XYQKeuFri">this</a> project.  <a href="http://www.iliketomakestuff.com/">Bob Clagett</a> throws down a triple-back-flip with one-and-a-half twists and sticks the landing!  Ok, we might tweak this one up a bit, but man, the original is righteous!

If you don't want to sit through all the videos, here's the Reader's DigestÂ® run-down:

<li>Custom vinyl graphics bonded to the exterior of the cabinet</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi running RetroPie</li>
<li>Custom game control module</li>
<li>Sounds & lights</li>
